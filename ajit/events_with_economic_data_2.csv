The Oil Crisis of 1973,The first major energy crisis,"The Oil Crisis of 1973 was triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which began in October 1973. While this event technically falls just after the 1970 cutoff, its foreshadowing effects were heavily felt in the late 1960s with growing oil consumption in the U.S. The crisis led to skyrocketing oil prices and massive global economic shifts, emphasizing the world's dependency on oil and leading to recession, inflation, and long-term changes in energy policies.

The embargo led to skyrocketing oil prices, causing widespread panic and economic turmoil. The price of oil surged from $3 per barrel to nearly $12, resulting in long lines at gas stations, rationing, and inflation. Countries heavily dependent on oil imports were severely affected, leading to economic recession in many Western nations.

Many countries, especially industrialized nations, faced double-digit inflation and rising unemployment rates as economies contracted sharply. The recession led to decreased industrial production, rising costs of living, and increased government intervention in economies worldwide. Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom implemented policies to counter inflation and unemployment, leading to public discontent and strikes.

The 1979 Energy Crisis,Second oil crisis leads to economic shock.,"The 1979 energy crisis was triggered by the Iranian Revolution, leading to a reduction in oil exports from Iran and subsequent panic regarding oil supplies. Coupled with existing inflationary pressures from the previous oil crisis in 1973, this created a significant economic shock globally, with oil prices soaring to unprecedented levels. The price of oil nearly quadrupled, prompting widespread inflation and an economic downturn in the United States and other oil-dependent nations. Governments were forced to implement measures such as fuel rationing, energy conservation programs, and a shift towards alternative energy sources.

The Great Inflation,Period of high inflation affects economies globally.,"The Great Inflation, which began in the late 1960s and continued into the early 1980s, was characterized by rising inflation rates that impacted many countries, particularly in the West. Caused by a combination of factors including oil price shocks from the energy crises, increased government spending, and monetary policy decisions, inflation rates soared, reaching double digits in many countries. The purchasing power of consumers diminished substantially, leading to decreased economic growth and increasing unemployment—a situation termed 'stagflation.' Governments were compelled to shift their economic policies, with many adopting tighter monetary policies and austerity measures to control inflation.
